# Implement a Windows based GUI instead of a command line prompt

## Context and Problem Statement

A GUI should be implemented to enable the user of configuring the simulation, while providing the service to run and present the results of the simulation

## Considered Options

* WinForms
* MVVM in combination with WPF

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "MVVM with WPF", because 
* The seperation of concerns is maintained in an easier fashion
* It has a more straightforward data binding when compared with WinForms
* Is newer and still maintained

## Implementation Details
In order to prevent crossing boundaries, at least two separate projects / assemblies need to be added. These assemblies represent:
* The ViewModels: these may contain a reference to the models (which are objects representing the domain data). 
* The Views: these represent the views which are the FrontEnd for the ViewModels.

Additional libraries might need to be added, depending on future features.
